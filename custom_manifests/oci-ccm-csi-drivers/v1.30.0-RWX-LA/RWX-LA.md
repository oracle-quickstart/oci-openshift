### Overview

We are pleased to inform you that we have further enhanced the OCI CSI driver for OpenShift on OCI. In collaboration with the Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) team, who own and maintain the open source [oci-cloud-controller-manager](https://github.com/oracle/oci-cloud-controller-manager), we have added the capability to create Raw Block Volumes in ReadWriteMany mode and attach them to multiple nodes within the same Availability Domain (see [Limitations](#limitations)). The addition of this capability enables users to distribute workloads that used shared storage accross multiple nodes and take advantage of tools and software that utilize or require ReadWriteMany storage capabilities, such as [OpenShift Virtualization](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/virtualization/index) and the [Migration Toolkit for Virtualization](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/2.7/html/installing_and_using_the_migration_toolkit_for_virtualization/index).

This feature is currently only available as a Technical Preview in Limited Availability, but will be incorporated into a future version of the open source OCI CCM and CSI drivers we use for our OpenShift clusters today.

### Limitations

These RWX-enabled drivers are being made available as a Technical Preview in Limited Availability. While these drivers have been extensively tested by both our team and RedHat's, they have not been fully certified. Please be considerate of that when you choose what environments to test these in.

Be aware that the following limitations apply when using ReadWriteMany Raw Block Volumes:

1. ReadWriteMany accessMode is only available for Raw Block Volumes i.e. `volumeMode: Block`
2. The maximum number of different instances a volume can be attached to is **32**
3. Block Volumes can only be attached to instances within the same Availability Domain.
4. A Block Volume's performance (vpusPerGB) is shared between all of it's attachments.
5. The CSI driver can provision, attach, and mount Block Volumes to instances - it **can't** control read/write events between workloads and the underlying storage. To manage concurrent access and data integrity, users must rely on tools and software that are designed to handle this storage setup correctly.

### Driver Installation

Set the oci_driver_version variable to **v1.30.0-RWX-LA** when creating a cluster using the create-cluster stack to generate the dynamic_custom_manifest output with the RWX-enabled driver. To upgrade/change the OCI drivers on an existing OpenShift custer, apply the RWX-enabled OCI CSI driver manifests can be found in [01-oci-csi.yml](01-oci-csi.yml) manually or with the following command from within oci-openshift:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=<your_cluster_kubeconfig>

make update-drivers OCI_DRIVER_VERSION=v1.30.0-RWX-LA
```
